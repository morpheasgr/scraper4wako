# scraper4wako

This project was created to convert and maintain Syncler's community scrapers for wako/Helios users. This is for private convenience and is not meant for the broader public.

You are solely responsible for the content you watch online, these scrapers do not offer any content, they merely aid to web search on publicly available web resources.

## How to use
Click on any of the txt files in this repo (only ONE), then right click on "Raw" and copy the URL. You will get a raw.githubusercontent.com URL, that is the provider URL you need to enter in Helios.

If you don't understand how to do this here's the direct URLs, just copy one of them to the clipboard and paste/add it in Helios's provider settings.
